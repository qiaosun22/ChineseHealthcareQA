　　[Abstract] Objective To explore the clinical effect of nursing intervention in patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with pulmonary contusion. Methods Eighty patients with severe craniocerebral injury combined with pulmonary contusion in our hospital from May 2014 to May 2016 were selected. According to the random number method， the patients were divided into two groups， with 40 patients in each group. The control group was given routine nursing，and the experimental group was treated with comprehensive nursing intervention method. Then the clinical efficacy， the time of lung infection control， GCS score and satisfaction between the two groups were compared. Results The total effective rate of the patients in the experimental group was 87.5%， which was significantly higher than that of the control group（60.0%）， and the difference was statistically significant（P<0.05）. The satisfaction rates of the control group and the experimental group were 60.0%， 92.5%，respectively. The satisfaction rate of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group by statistical comparison（P<0.05）. Before nursing， there was no significant difference in GCS scores between the two groups. The GCS score of the experimental group was（12.8±1.4） points， and the GCS score was （4.8±1.3） points in the control group （P<0.05）. The score of GCS in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group after intervention（P<0.05）. The control time of pulmonary infection in the control group was（14.5±3.9） days， and the control time of lung infection in the experimental group was（8.6±3.8） days， and there was significant difference between the two groups（P<0.05）. Conclusion Nursing intervention taken in patients with severe craniocerebral injury and pulmonary contusion has significant clinical recovery，which shortens the control time of lung infection and significantly increases the prognosis of GCS， and can effectively promote the recovery of patients.   　　综上所述，对于重型颅脑损伤合并肺挫伤患者，分析其致病的原因，然后采取有效的护理干预措施，不仅可以显著提高临床疗效，还会改善患者的预后生活质量，可以在临床上推广应用。
