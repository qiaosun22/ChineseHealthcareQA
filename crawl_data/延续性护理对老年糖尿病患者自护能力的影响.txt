　　[Abstract] Objective To explore the clinical effect of continuing nursing in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus， and to study its effect on patients' self-care ability. Methods A total of 89 elderly patients with diabetes mellitus in our hospital from January 2015 to January 2016 were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomly grouped and treated with different nursing methods. The control group（n=44） was given routine nursing measures and health education. The study group（n=45） was given continuing nursing interventions based on the treatment of the control group after discharge. The self-care status between the two groups on admission and at one year after discharge was compared. The self-care ability measurement scale was used. Results There were no significant differences in the indicators of ESCA including the scores of self-care ability， nursing skills， nursing responsibility， self-concept and health theory between the study group and the control group（P>0.05） at discharge. The scores of self-care ability， nursing skills， nursing responsibility， self-concept and health theory in the study group were significantly higher than those of the control group at one year after discharge. And the total score of self-care ability in the study group was（104.32±9.93） at discharge and（116.18±11.04）at one year after discharge. The total score of self-care ability in the control group was（103.97±11.65）at discharge and（101.91±10.14）at one year after discharge. There was significant difference between the two groups（P<0.05）. Conclusion Continuing nursing has an obvious effect in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus， which can effectively improve the self-care ability of patients and is worthy of clinical application.   　　综上所述，延续性护理能够有效提高老年糖尿病患者的自我护理能力，在实施期间，能够有效提高患者的自我护理能力，进而达到提高生活质量的目的，是一种有效的护理措施。
