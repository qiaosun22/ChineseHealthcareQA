　　【摘要】 目的：探讨肺癌化疗患者PICC置管中护理的应用。方法：选取本院2013年9月-2014年11月收治的96例肺癌化疗患者作为研究对象，按照随机数字表法将其分为观察组和对照组，每组各48例。对照组给予常规护理，观察组在此基础上再予以PICC置管护理，观察比较两组患者PICC置管留置时间及成功率、并发症发生情况、患者生活质量评分及护理满意度。结果：观察组PICC置管平均留置时间显著长于对照组，留置成功率显著高于对照组，差异均有统计学意义（P<0.05）。观察组护理后的心理领域、社会关系领域及生活质量总得分评分均显著高于对照组，差异均有统计学意义（P<0.05）。观察组并发症总发生率6.25%显著低于对照组的20.83%，且护理满意度95.83%显著高于对照组的66.67%，差异均有统计学意义（P<0.05）。结论：应用PICC置管护理方法可有效提高肺癌化疗患者PICC置管成功率，减少置管并发症，对改善患者生活质量有重要意义。

　　【Abstract】 Objective：To investigate the application of nursing on lung cancer chemotherapy patients with PICC catheter.Method：96 lung cancer patients with chemotherapy admitted to our hospital from September 2013 to November 2014 were selected as research objects，they were randomly divided into the observation group and the control group，48 cases in each group.The control group was given routine nursing care，the observation group was given PICC catheter nursing on the basis of control group.The PICC catheter indwelling time and success rate，the incidence of complications，patients’ quality of life score and nursing satisfaction between the two groups were observed and compared.Result：The average PICC catheter indwelling time of the observation group was significantly longer than the control group，the success rate of indwelling in the observation group was significantly higher than the control group，the differences were statistically significant（P<0.05）.The scores of psychological，social relations and the total score of quality of life in the observation group after nursing were significantly higher than those in the control group，the differences were statistically significant（P<0.05）.The total incidence of complications in the observation group （6.25%） was significantly lower than 20.83% in the control group，the nursing satisfaction of the observation group （95.83%） was significantly higher than 66.67% of the control group，the differences were statistically significant（P<0.05）.Conclusion：The application of PICC catheter nursing method can effectively improve the success rate of PICC catheter lung cancer chemotherapy patients，reduce the complications of catheter，has important significance to improve the patients quality of life.
